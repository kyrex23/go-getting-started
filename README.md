## Introduction

Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled language designed for simplicity and efficiency.

It has gained popularity for its clean syntax, strong standard library, and excellent performance.

Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced programmer looking to learn Go, this repository is a great place
to start.

### Usage of workspaces to manage a multi-module repository

This repository contains multiple Go projects, so workspaces will be used to handle them more easily.

You can create a workspace by running the following command at the root of the repository:
```bash
go work init .
```

This will create a `go.work` file in which to include existing modules, as shown below:
```go
go 1.21.2

use (
	./hello-world
)
```

You can then execute a module with the following command:
```bash
go run ./hello-world
```
