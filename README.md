## Introduction

Oops, I forgot it... ðŸ˜…

### Usage of workspaces to manage a multi-module repository

This repository contains multiple Go projects, so workspaces will be used to handle them more easily.

You can create a workspace by running the following command at the root of the repository:
```bash
go work init .
```

This will create a `go.work` file in which to include existing modules, as shown below:
```go
go 1.21.2

use (
	./hello-world
)
```

You can then execute a module with the following command:
```bash
go run ./hello-world
```
